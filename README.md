# The SDK

Vectorworks http://www.vectorworks.net provides an open architecture that allows developers to supplement or replace existing Vectorworks functionality. From the userâ€™s perspective, these new tools, menu commands, and objects are indistinguishable from those built into Vectorworks. As such, they are first-class solutions for the user.

The SDK https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/support/custom/sdk/sdkdown provides OS-independent functionality for accessing the application routines. Also, it provides functions for creating OS-independent User Interfaces for your plug-ins.

## Basics

The Vectorworks SDK uses the C++ language to develop extension functionality. To develop SDK plug-ins for Vectorworks, you will need the following tools:

Before you begin, you should review [the Vectorworks environment](Info/The%20Vectorworks%20Environment.md).

The Vectorworks SDK provides [some specific types](Info/Types.md). A developer should use the recommended types. Here is a short list of the most commonly used types:
- [MCObjectHandle](Info/Type%20MCObjectHandle.md)
- [TXString](Info/Type%20TXString.md)
- [TXStringArray](Info/Type%20TXStringArray.md)
- [WorldPt](Info/Type%20WorldPt.md)
- [WorldPt3](Info/Type%20WorldPt3.md)
- [TransformMatrix](Info/Type%20TransformMatrix.md)

## Plug-ins Modules

Vectorworks plug-in is a dynamic library on Windows and a specific type of bundle on Mac.

On launch, Vectorworks enumerates the 'Plug-ins' folder next to the application for dynamic libraries (or bundles). Also, Vectorworks traverses shortcuts (aliases) placed in the folder hierarchy.

Each Plug-in module is a [VCOM (Vectorworks Component Object Model)](Info/VCOM%20(Vectorworks%20Component%20Object%20Model).md) provider library. This library provides one or many VCOM implementations of standard interfaces for the different extensions.

[More information on the topic see here](Info/Plug-in%20Module.md).
